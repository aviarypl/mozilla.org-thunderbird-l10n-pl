        <p>We want to thank you for your loyalty to the Mozilla project and for using Thunderbird, our email software. This is awesome!</p>

        <p>Sometimes it is time for a change. Starting on April 24, 2012, we will stop supporting Thunderbird version 3.1.x. What this means is, while you can continue to use Thunderbird 3.1, we will not be making improvements to Thunderbird 3.1 which would include security and performance fixes.</p>

          <li>experience better performance because we continually work to improve responsiveness on a regular basis</li>
          <li>and enjoy many new features that are already appreciated by millions of users.</li>
        </ul>
